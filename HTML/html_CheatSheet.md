# Extensive HTML Prerequisite Course for Full-Stack Web Development ðŸš€

Welcome to the foundational course on HTML (HyperText Markup Language)! This document is designed to be a comprehensive guide for college students embarking on their full-stack web development journey. HTML is the backbone of every webpage, providing the structure and meaning to your content. Without it, there would be no web as we know it.

In this course, we will break down every essential HTML tag, attribute, and concept. For each topic, you'll find:

-   **Detailed Explanations:** What the tag/concept is, why it's used, and how it functions.
    
-   **Code Blocks:** Practical examples you can copy and try yourself.
    
-   **Parameters & Conditions:** A deep dive into the attributes and specific scenarios for use.
    
-   **External Links:** Relevant resources (like W3Schools or MDN) where you can visualize the code's output and explore further.
    

Let's begin building the web!

## 1. Understanding HTML

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It uses a system of "markup" to annotate text documents, defining their structure and meaning (semantics). These annotations are called **tags**.

**Why is it used?** HTML provides the foundational structure for all web content. It tells the browser what each piece of content represents: is it a heading, a paragraph, an image, a link, or a list? Without HTML, a web page would just be plain, unstructured text.

**How is it used?** You write HTML code in a text editor, save it as a `.html` file, and then open it in a web browser. The browser reads the HTML and renders the content according to the instructions given by the tags.

**Parameters/Conditions:** HTML documents are text files. They must start with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and typically have an `<html>` root element. HTML is generally forgiving with minor syntax errors, but following best practices ensures cross-browser compatibility and better maintainability.

## 2. Basic HTML Document Structure

Every HTML document starts with a standard boilerplate. This structure provides the essential framework for your webpage.

**Code Block:**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Awesome Webpage</title>
    <!-- Link to external CSS or JavaScript goes here -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- All visible content of your webpage goes here -->
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is the content of my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>

```

**Explanation:**

-   **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**:
    
    -   **Why used?** This declaration defines the document type to be HTML5. It's not an HTML tag itself, but an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures the browser renders the page in "standards mode" rather than "quirks mode," which can lead to inconsistent rendering.
        
    -   **How used?** It must be the very first line of your HTML document, before the `<html>` tag.
        
    -   **Parameters/Conditions:** No parameters. It's a simple, mandatory declaration for modern HTML documents.
        
-   **`<html lang="en">`**:
    
    -   **Why used?** This is the root element of an HTML page. All other HTML elements (except `<!DOCTYPE>`) are descendants of this element. The `lang` attribute specifies the primary language of the document (e.g., "en" for English, "es" for Spanish). This is crucial for accessibility (screen readers can pronounce text correctly) and search engine optimization (search engines can better understand the content's language).
        
    -   **How used?** It encloses all other content on the page.
        
    -   **Parameters/Conditions:** The `lang` attribute is highly recommended. You can specify different language codes based on ISO 639-1 standards.
        
-   **`<head>`**:
    
    -   **Why used?** This element contains meta-information about the HTML document. This information is _not_ displayed on the webpage itself but is vital for the browser, search engines, and other web services.
        
    -   **How used?** It's placed immediately after the opening `<html>` tag and before the `<body>` tag.
        
    -   **Parameters/Conditions:** Contains elements like `<meta>`, `<title>`, `<link>`, `<style>`, `<script>`, `<base>`.
        
-   **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**:
    
    -   **Why used?** The `<meta>` tag provides metadata about the HTML document. The `charset` attribute specifies the character encoding for the document. `UTF-8` is the universal character set that covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world. Using it prevents display issues with special characters (like emojis, accented letters, etc.).
        
    -   **How used?** Placed inside the `<head>` tag. It's good practice to put it as one of the first elements inside `<head>`.
        
    -   **Parameters/Conditions:**  `charset` is its primary attribute for character encoding. Always use `UTF-8`.
        
-   **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**:
    
    -   **Why used?** This `<meta>` tag is crucial for **responsive web design**. It tells the browser how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
        
        -   `width=device-width`: Sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen.
            
        -   `initial-scale=1.0`: Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
            
    -   **How used?** Placed inside the `<head>` tag.
        
    -   **Parameters/Conditions:** Essential for ensuring your website adapts well to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
        
-   **`<title>My Awesome Webpage</title>`**:
    
    -   **Why used?** This element defines the title of the HTML document. This title appears in the browser's title bar or tab. It's also used by search engines (as the clickable title in search results) and for bookmarking.
        
    -   **How used?** Placed inside the `<head>` tag.
        
    -   **Parameters/Conditions:** The text inside `<title>` should be concise and descriptive of the page's content.
        
-   **`<body>`**:
    
    -   **Why used?** This element contains all the visible content of an HTML document. Everything you see on a webpage â€“ text, images, videos, links, forms, etc. â€“ is placed inside the `<body>` tag.
        
    -   **How used?** Placed immediately after the closing `</head>` tag and before the closing `</html>` tag.
        
    -   **Parameters/Conditions:** Only one `<body>` element is allowed per HTML document.

## 3. Text Formatting Elements

HTML provides a variety of tags to structure and format text, giving it semantic meaning and aiding readability.

### 3.1 Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)

**Why used?** Headings are used to define the hierarchical structure of content on a webpage. `<h1>` represents the most important heading (usually the main title of the page), while `<h6>` represents the least important. They are crucial for SEO, accessibility (screen readers use them to navigate content), and document outline.

**How used?** Enclose your heading text within the appropriate heading tags.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   There should generally only be one `<h1>` per page, representing the main topic.
    
-   Headings should be used hierarchically (e.g., `<h2>` under `<h1>`, `<h3>` under `<h2>`). Do not skip levels for visual styling; use CSS for that.
    
-   They are block-level elements, meaning they start on a new line and take up the full available width by default.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<h1>This is a Main Page Title (H1)</h1>
<h2>This is a Major Section Heading (H2)</h2>
<h3>This is a Subsection Heading (H3)</h3>
<h4>This is a Sub-subsection Heading (H4)</h4>
<h5>This is a Minor Heading (H5)</h5>
<h6>This is the Least Important Heading (H6)</h6>

```

-   [MDN Web Docs: Heading elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements "null")
    

### 3.2 Paragraphs (`<p>`)

**Why used?** The `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph of text. It's the most common tag for regular text content.

**How used?** Wrap your block of text within `<p>` and `</p>` tags.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   Paragraphs are block-level elements, meaning they start on a new line and browsers typically add some space (margin) before and after them.
    
-   Do not use `<p>` to create spacing between elements; use CSS margins for that.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>This is the first paragraph of my document. It contains general textual content that provides information to the reader.</p>
<p>This is a second paragraph. Each paragraph will typically appear on its own line with some vertical spacing.</p>

```

-   [MDN Web Docs: The Paragraph element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p "null")
    

### 3.3 Line Breaks (`<br>`)

**Why used?** The `<br>` tag is used to insert a single line break. It's a self-closing tag (it doesn't have a closing tag).

**How used?** Place `<br>` where you want the text to break to the next line without starting a new paragraph.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   It's an inline element.
    
-   Use `br` for line breaks within a block of text, like in addresses or poems, where starting a new paragraph would be semantically incorrect. Do not use multiple `<br>` tags to create vertical space; use CSS margins or padding.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>
    123 Web Street<br>
    HTML City, CA 90210<br>
    USA
</p>
<p>
    This text is on one line.<br>
    This text is on a new line within the same paragraph.
</p>

```

### 3.4 Horizontal Rule (`<hr>`)

**Why used?** The `<hr>` tag is used to represent a thematic break or a change in content within a section. Visually, it's often rendered as a horizontal line. It's a self-closing tag.

**How used?** Place `<hr>` where you want a thematic separation.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   It's a block-level element.
    
-   It should be used for semantic separation, not just for drawing lines. For purely decorative lines, use CSS borders.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>This is the content before the thematic break.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is the content after the thematic break, indicating a new topic or section within the same main flow.</p>

```

-   [MDN Web Docs: The Thematic Break (horizontal rule) element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr "null")
    

### 3.5 Bold & Strong (`<b>`, `<strong>`)

**Why used?**

-   **`<b>` (Bold Text):** Used to draw the reader's attention to text without conveying any extra importance. It's purely for presentational bolding.
    
-   **`<strong>` (Strong Importance):** Used to indicate that the enclosed text has strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. It typically renders as bold, but its semantic meaning is different from `<b>`.
    

**How used?** Wrap the text you want to bold or emphasize within the respective tags.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   Both are inline elements.
    
-   **Best Practice:** Prefer `<strong>` for content that is genuinely important (e.g., warnings, key terms). Use `<b>` only when you want to bold text for visual emphasis without adding semantic importance. For most cases, `<strong>` is the better choice for semantic clarity.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>This is a <b>bold</b> word, purely for visual emphasis.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>very important</strong> warning: Do not proceed without permission!</p>

```

### 3.6 Italic & Emphasis (`<i>`, `<em>`)

**Why used?**

-   **`<i>` (Italic Text):** Used to represent text that is set off from the normal prose, such as a technical term, a foreign phrase, or a thought. It's purely for presentational italics.
    
-   **`<em>` (Emphasized Text):** Used to indicate emphasis. The content inside is spoken with an emphasis (like a stress in speech). It typically renders as italic, but its semantic meaning is different from `<i>`.
    

**How used?** Wrap the text you want to italicize or emphasize within the respective tags.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   Both are inline elements.
    
-   **Best Practice:** Prefer `<em>` for content that needs emphasis (e.g., "I _really_ love HTML"). Use `<i>` when the text is distinct from the surrounding text but doesn't necessarily have added importance (e.g., a book title, a scientific name).
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>The name of the book is <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>.</p>
<p>You should <em>never</em> forget to close your tags.</p>

```

### 3.7 Superscript & Subscript (`<sup>`, `<sub>`)

**Why used?**

-   **`<sup>` (Superscript):** Used for text that should be displayed higher than the normal baseline, often for footnotes, exponents, or ordinal indicators.
    
-   **`<sub>` (Subscript):** Used for text that should be displayed lower than the normal baseline, often for chemical formulas or mathematical variables.
    

**How used?** Wrap the text that needs to be superscripted or subscripted.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   Both are inline elements.
    
-   Use them for their semantic purpose, not just for visual positioning (use CSS for that).
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>The chemical formula for water is H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p>In mathematics, E = mc<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Today is the 10<sup>th</sup> of July.</p>

```

### 3.8 Preformatted Text (`<pre>`)

**Why used?** The `<pre>` tag defines preformatted text. Text within this element is displayed in a fixed-width font (like Courier) and preserves both spaces and line breaks exactly as they are written in the HTML source code. This is useful for displaying code snippets, ASCII art, or text that relies on specific formatting.

**How used?** Place the text you want to preformat inside `<pre>` tags.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   It's a block-level element.
    
-   Be aware that long lines within `<pre>` can cause horizontal scrolling if not handled with CSS (e.g., `overflow-x: auto;`).
    

**Code Block:**

```
<pre>
This is preformatted text.
It preserves      spaces
and line breaks.
    Like a poem or code.
</pre>

```

### 3.9 Code (`<code>`)

**Why used?** The `<code>` tag is used to define a short piece of computer code. It semantically indicates that the enclosed text is a fragment of code.

**How used?** Wrap the code snippet within `<code>` tags.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   It's an inline element.
    
-   It typically renders in a monospace font.
    
-   For multi-line code blocks, it's common practice to wrap `<code>` inside `<pre>` to preserve formatting (spaces and line breaks).
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>The `document.getElementById()` method is commonly used in JavaScript.</p>

<pre><code>
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
greet("Students");
</code></pre>

### 3.10 Quotations (`<blockquote>`, `<q>`)

**Why used?**

-   **`<blockquote>` (Block Quotation):** Used for long quotations that are typically displayed as a block, often with indentation. It semantically indicates that the enclosed text is a direct quotation from another source.
    
-   **`<q>` (Inline Quotation):** Used for short, inline quotations. Browsers typically add quotation marks around the content automatically.
    

**How used?**

-   For `<blockquote>`, place the entire quoted block inside. The `cite` attribute can be used to provide the URL of the source.
    
-   For `<q>`, place the short quote inside. The `cite` attribute can also be used here.
    

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   `<blockquote>` is a block-level element.
    
-   `<q>` is an inline element.
    
-   The `cite` attribute (a URL) is optional but good for attribution.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>According to Shakespeare:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.shakespeare.com/hamlet">
    To be, or not to be, that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
    No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
    The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
    To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,
    For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause.
</blockquote>

### 3.11 Small Text (`<small>`)

**Why used?** The `<small>` tag is used to represent side comments and small print, like copyright and legal text. It typically renders as smaller text.

**How used?** Wrap the text you want to denote as small print.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   It's an inline element.
    
-   Do not use it for general text sizing; use CSS `font-size` for that. It has semantic meaning for "small print."
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>This is normal text. <small>This is some fine print or disclaimer.</small></p>
<footer>
    <p><small>&copy; 2025 My Awesome Website. All rights reserved.</small></p>
</footer>

### 3.12 Marked/Highlighted Text (`<mark>`)

**Why used?** The `<mark>` tag is used to highlight parts of text for emphasis or relevance in a particular context. Browsers typically render it with a yellow background.

**How used?** Wrap the text you want to highlight.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   It's an inline element.
    
-   Use it when you want to draw attention to a specific part of the text, as if it were highlighted with a marker.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>Make sure to <mark>read the instructions carefully</mark> before proceeding.</p>
<p>The search results showed the keyword <mark>HTML</mark> multiple times.</p>

### 3.13 Deleted & Inserted Text (`<del>`, `<ins>`)

**Why used?**

-   **`<del>` (Deleted Text):** Represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers typically render it with a strikethrough.
    
-   **`<ins>` (Inserted Text):** Represents a range of text that has been added to a document. Browsers typically render it with an underline.
    

**How used?** Wrap the text that has been deleted or inserted. Both can use the `cite` attribute (URL of a document explaining the change) and the `datetime` attribute (date and time of the change).

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   Both are inline elements.
    
-   Useful for showing revisions or changes in a document.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>Original price: <del>$20.00</del> <ins>$15.00</ins></p>
<p>This document was last updated on <del datetime="2024-07-10">July 10, 2024</del> <ins datetime="2025-07-15">July 15, 2025</ins>.</p>

## 4. Links (`<a>`)

The `<a>` (anchor) tag is one of the most fundamental elements of the web, used to create hyperlinks.

**Why used?** It allows users to navigate between pages, download files, send emails, and jump to specific sections within a page.

**How used?** The `href` attribute is essential, specifying the destination URL. The text between the opening and closing `<a>` tags is what the user clicks.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   **`href` (Hypertext Reference):** Specifies the URL the link goes to. This is the most important attribute.
    
-   **`target`:** Specifies where to open the linked document.
    
    -   `_self` (default): Opens the document in the same window/tab.
        
    -   `_blank`: Opens the document in a new window/tab.
        
    -   `_parent`: Opens the document in the parent frame.
        
    -   `_top`: Opens the document in the full body of the window.
        
-   **`title`:** Provides extra information about the link, which often appears as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. Good for accessibility.
    
-   **`download`:** (HTML5) Prompts the user to download the linked URL instead of navigating to it. The value can be the suggested filename for the download.
    
-   **`rel` (Relationship):** Describes the relationship of the linked document to the current document (e.g., `nofollow`, `noopener`, `noreferrer`).
    

### 4.1 External Links

Links to other websites.

**Code Block:**

```
<p>Visit the official <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" title="Go to Google's homepage">Google website</a>.</p>
<p>Learn more at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN Web Docs</a>.</p>

```

**Explanation:**

-   The `target="_blank"` ensures Google opens in a new tab, keeping your current page open.
    
-   `rel="noopener noreferrer"` is a security best practice for `target="_blank"` links to prevent "tabnabbing" and prevent the new page from accessing the original page's `window.opener`.

### 4.2 Internal Links (Same Page)

Links to specific sections within the _same_ HTML document. This requires giving an `id` to the target element.

**Code Block:**

```
<p><a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a></p>
<p><a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a></p>

<!-- ... much content in between ... -->

<h2 id="section1">Section 1: Introduction</h2>
<p>Content for the first section...</p>

<!-- ... much content in between ... -->

<h2 id="section2">Section 2: Advanced Topics</h2>
<p>Content for the second section...</p>

```

**Explanation:**

-   The `href` attribute starts with `#` followed by the `id` of the element you want to link to.
    
-   The target element must have a unique `id` attribute matching the value in the `href`.

### 4.3 Internal Links (Different Page)

Links to other HTML documents within your own website.

**Code Block:**

Assume you have `index.html` and `about.html` in the same directory:

```
<!-- In index.html -->
<p>Go to the <a href="about.html">About Us</a> page.</p>

<!-- In about.html -->
<p>Back to <a href="index.html">Home</a>.</p>

```

**Explanation:**

-   The `href` contains the relative path to the target HTML file.
    
-   If `about.html` was in a `pages` subdirectory, the `href` would be `pages/about.html`.
    
-   If you needed to go up one directory, you'd use `../another-page.html`.

### 4.4 Email Links

Links that open the user's default email client with a pre-filled recipient.

**Code Block:**

```
<p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@example.com">info@example.com</a>.</p>
<p>Send a message with a subject: <a href="mailto:support@example.com?subject=Support%20Request&body=Hello,%20I%20have%20a%20question.">Email Support</a>.</p>

```

**Explanation:**

-   The `href` attribute starts with `mailto:`.
    
-   You can add parameters like `?subject=`, `&body=`, `&cc=`, `&bcc=` to pre-fill the email. Spaces must be encoded as `%20`.

### 4.5 Download Links

Links that prompt the browser to download the linked resource instead of opening it.

**Code Block:**

```
<p>Download our <a href="documents/report.pdf" download="Annual_Report_2025.pdf">Annual Report (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p>Download the image: <a href="images/logo.png" download>Download Logo</a></p>

```

**Explanation:**

-   The `download` attribute is a boolean attribute. If present, it prompts a download.
    
-   You can optionally provide a value for the `download` attribute, which will be the suggested filename for the downloaded file. If omitted, the original filename is used.

## 5. Images (`<img>`)

The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image into an HTML document. It's a self-closing tag.

**Why used?** Images are crucial for visual appeal, conveying information, and enhancing user experience on a webpage.

**How used?** The `src` attribute is mandatory, pointing to the image file. The `alt` attribute is also mandatory for accessibility.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   **`src` (Source):** Specifies the path to the image file. This can be a relative path (e.g., `images/photo.jpg`) or an absolute URL (e.g., `https://example.com/images/photo.jpg`).
    
-   **`alt` (Alternative Text):** Provides a text description of the image. This is crucial for:
    
    -   Screen readers (for visually impaired users).
        
    -   When the image fails to load (e.g., broken link, slow connection).
        
    -   Search engine optimization (SEO).
        
    -   **Always include meaningful `alt` text.**
        
-   **`width`:** Specifies the width of the image in pixels.
    
-   **`height`:** Specifies the height of the image in pixels.
    
    -   **Note on `width`/`height`:** While you can set these directly in HTML, it's generally better to control image dimensions and responsiveness using CSS to separate presentation from content. However, including them in HTML helps prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) by reserving space for the image before it loads.
        
-   **`loading="lazy"`:** (HTML5) Suggests to the browser that it should defer loading of images that are off-screen until the user scrolls near them. Improves page load performance.
    

### 5.1 Basic Image Inclusion

**Code Block:**

```
<img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/000000/FFFFFF?text=My+Image" alt="A placeholder image with dark background and white text saying 'My Image'" width="600" height="400" loading="lazy">

<p>This is a small icon: <img src="images/icon.png" alt="A small blue icon" width="32" height="32"></p>

```

**Explanation:**

-   The first example uses a placeholder image URL for demonstration. In a real project, `src` would point to your actual image file.
    
-   The `alt` text describes the image content.
    
-   `width` and `height` are set to reserve space.
    
-   `loading="lazy"` is added for performance.

### 5.2 Relative vs. Absolute Paths

Understanding how to link to your images (and other files) is fundamental.

-   **Relative Path:** The path to the file is relative to the current HTML document's location.
    
    -   `src="image.jpg"`: Image is in the same directory as the HTML file.
        
    -   `src="images/image.jpg"`: Image is in a subdirectory named `images` within the current directory.
        
    -   `src="../image.jpg"`: Image is in the parent directory (one level up from the current directory).
        
    -   `src="../../images/image.jpg"`: Image is two levels up, then in an `images` subdirectory.
        
-   **Absolute Path (URL):** The full web address of the image, starting with `http://` or `https://`. Used for images hosted on other servers.
    

**Code Block (Illustrative):**

```
<!-- Assuming this HTML file is at /my-project/index.html -->

<!-- Image in the same directory as index.html -->
<img src="my-photo.jpg" alt="A photo">

<!-- Image in a subdirectory 'assets' -->
<img src="assets/banner.png" alt="A banner">

<!-- Image in a parent directory 'shared-images' -->
<!-- If index.html is in /my-project/pages/index.html, this would point to /my-project/shared-images/logo.gif -->
<img src="../shared-images/logo.gif" alt="Company logo">

<!-- Image from an external website -->
<img src="https://www.example.com/external-image.jpg" alt="An image from another website">

```

### 5.3 Image Maps (`<map>`, `<area>`)

**Why used?** An image map allows you to define clickable areas (hotspots) on an image. Each area can link to a different destination.

**How used?**

-   The `<img>` tag needs a `usemap` attribute, whose value refers to the `name` or `id` of the `<map>` element.
    
-   The `<map>` element contains one or more `<area>` tags.
    
-   Each `<area>` tag defines a clickable region.
    

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   **`<map>`:**
    
    -   `name`: A unique name for the map, referenced by `<img>`'s `usemap`.
        
-   **`<area>`:**
    
    -   `shape`: Defines the shape of the clickable area (`rect` for rectangle, `circle` for circle, `poly` for polygon, `default` for the entire image).
        
    -   `coords`: Defines the coordinates of the shape.
        
        -   `rect`: `x1,y1,x2,y2` (top-left x,y and bottom-right x,y)
            
        -   `circle`: `x,y,radius` (center x,y and radius)
            
        -   `poly`: `x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn` (coordinates of each vertex)
            
    -   `href`: The URL the area links to.
        
    -   `alt`: Alternative text for the area (important for accessibility).
        
    -   `target`: Same as `<a>` tag's `target`.
        

**Code Block:**

```
<img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/FF0000/FFFFFF?text=Clickable+Map" alt="A clickable map of a red square" usemap="#imagemap-example">

<map name="imagemap-example">
    <!-- Clickable rectangle in the top-left quadrant -->
    <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,300,200" href="https://www.example.com/top-left" alt="Top Left Area">
    <!-- Clickable circle in the bottom-right quadrant -->
    <area shape="circle" coords="450,300,100" href="https://www.example.com/bottom-right" alt="Bottom Right Area">
</map>

### 5.4 Figures and Captions (`<figure>`, `<figcaption>`)

**Why used?** The `<figure>` element is used to encapsulate self-contained content (like images, diagrams, code listings, videos, etc.) that is referenced from the main flow of a document, but whose position is independent of the main flow. The `<figcaption>` element provides a caption for the `<figure>` element.

**How used?** Place the content (e.g., `<img>`) inside `<figure>`, and the caption inside `<figcaption>`.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   `<figure>` is a block-level element.
    
-   `<figcaption>` must be the first or last child of its parent `<figure>`.
    
-   This semantic grouping helps improve accessibility and document structure.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<figure>
    <img src="https://placehold.co/400x250/007BFF/FFFFFF?text=Sunset" alt="A beautiful sunset over the ocean">
    <figcaption>Fig. 1: A stunning sunset view, symbolizing the end of a productive day.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <pre><code>
        function hello() {
            console.log("Hello, HTML!");
        }
    </code></pre>
    <figcaption>Code Example 1.1: A simple JavaScript function.</figcaption>

## 6. Lists

HTML provides three types of lists to organize content: unordered, ordered, and description lists.

### 6.1 Unordered Lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`)

**Why used?** Used for lists of items where the order does not matter. Each item is typically marked with a bullet point.

**How used?** The `<ul>` (unordered list) tag is the container, and each list item is defined by an `<li>` (list item) tag.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   `<ul>` is a block-level element.
    
-   `<li>` is a block-level element.
    
-   You can nest lists within each other.
    
-   The default bullet style can be changed with CSS (`list-style-type`).
    

**Code Block:**

```
<h3>My Favorite Hobbies:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Reading</li>
    <li>Hiking</li>
    <li>Coding</li>
    <li>Cooking</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shopping List:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Bread
        <ul>
            <li>Whole Wheat</li>

### 6.2 Ordered Lists (`<ol>`, `<li>`)

**Why used?** Used for lists of items where the order _does_ matter, such as steps in a recipe, a ranking, or a sequence of instructions. Each item is typically marked with a number.

**How used?** The `<ol>` (ordered list) tag is the container, and each list item is defined by an `<li>` (list item) tag.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   `start`: (Optional) Specifies the start value of the list numbering.
    
-   `type`: (Optional) Specifies the type of marker (`1` for numbers, `a` for lowercase letters, `A` for uppercase letters, `i` for lowercase Roman numerals, `I` for uppercase Roman numerals).
    
-   `reversed`: (Optional) A boolean attribute that specifies that the list order should be descending.
    
-   `<li>` can have a `value` attribute to change its specific number in an ordered list.

### 6.3 Description Lists (`<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`)

**Why used?** Used for lists of terms and their descriptions, like a glossary, dictionary, or a list of FAQs.

**How used?**

-   `<dl>` (description list) is the container.
    
-   `<dt>` (description term) defines the term.
    
-   `<dd>` (description description) defines the description for the term.
    

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   `<dl>` is a block-level element.
    
-   Each `<dt>` can have one or more `<dd>` elements.
    
-   Multiple `<dt>` elements can share the same `<dd>`.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<h3>Glossary of Web Terms:</h3>

## 7. Tables (`<table>`)

HTML tables are used to display tabular data (data arranged in rows and columns).

**Why used?** To present data in a structured, grid-like format, making it easy to read and compare. **Do not use tables for page layout; use CSS (Flexbox or Grid) for that.**

**How used?**

-   `<table>`: The container for the entire table.
    
-   `<tr>`: Defines a table row.
    
-   `<th>`: Defines a table header cell (content is typically bold and centered by default).
    
-   `<td>`: Defines a standard table data cell.
    

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   Table elements are block-level.
    
-   `<th>` and `<td>` must be children of `<tr>`.
    
-   `<tr>` must be a child of `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, or `<tfoot>`.
    

### 7.1 Basic Table Structure

**Code Block:**

```
<table border="1"> <!-- The border attribute is deprecated, use CSS for styling -->
    <caption>Monthly Sales Report</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>Month</th>
        <th>Sales</th>
        <th>Profit</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>January</td>
        <td>$1000</td>
        <td>$300</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>February</td>
        <td>$1200</td>
        <td>$400</td>
    </tr>
</table>

```

**Explanation:**

-   The `border="1"` attribute is old HTML. In modern web development, you'd use CSS to style the table borders.
    
-   `<caption>`: Provides a title or caption for the table. It should be the first child of `<table>`.

-   [MDN Web Docs: The Table element (`<table>`)](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table%5D(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) "null")
    

### 7.2 Table Headers, Body, and Footer (`<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`)

**Why used?** These elements semantically group the content of a table into header, body, and footer sections. This improves accessibility, allows browsers to scroll the body independently of the header/footer, and enables specific styling.

**How used?**

-   `<thead>`: Contains the header rows (`<tr>` with `<th>` cells).
    
-   `<tbody>`: Contains the main data rows (`<tr>` with `<td>` cells). A table can have multiple `<tbody>` elements.
    
-   `<tfoot>`: Contains the footer rows (e.g., summary, totals).
    

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>` must be direct children of `<table>`.
    
-   The order in HTML should be `<thead>`, `<tfoot>`, `<tbody>` (though browsers will render `<tfoot>` at the bottom regardless). For clarity, it's often written as `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<table border="1">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Product</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
            <th>Price</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Laptop</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>$1200</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Mouse</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>$25</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Keyboard</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>$75</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">Total Items: 4</td>
            <td>Total: $1325</td>
        </tr>
    </tfoot>
</table>

```

### 7.3 Spanning Rows and Columns (`rowspan`, `colspan`)

**Why used?** These attributes allow a single table cell (`<th>` or `<td>`) to span across multiple rows or columns, creating more complex table layouts.

**How used?** Add `rowspan` or `colspan` attributes to `<th>` or `<td>` tags with a numeric value indicating how many rows/columns the cell should span.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   **`colspan`:** Specifies the number of columns a cell should span.
    
-   **`rowspan`:** Specifies the number of rows a cell should span.
    
-   Be careful when using these, as they can make table structure complex. Ensure the total number of cells in a row (considering spans) matches the expected number of columns.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<table border="1">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2">Name</th> <!-- Spans 2 columns -->
            <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>John</td>
            <td>Doe</td>
            <td>30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Jane</td> <!-- Spans 2 rows -->
            <td>Smith</td>
            <td>25</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <!-- No td for Jane here, as it's spanned -->
            <td>Miller</td>
            <td>28</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## 8. Forms (`<form>`)

HTML forms are essential for collecting user input. They allow users to interact with your website by submitting data (e.g., login credentials, search queries, comments, contact information).

### 8.1 The `<form>` Element

**Why used?** The `<form>` element is a container for all interactive controls that allow users to submit information.

**How used?** Wrap all your form input elements within `<form>` and `</form>`.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   **`action`:** Specifies the URL where the form data will be sent when submitted. This is typically a server-side script.
    
-   **`method`:** Specifies the HTTP method used to send the form data.
    
    -   `GET` (default): Appends form data to the URL as query parameters. Suitable for non-sensitive data (e.g., search queries) as it's visible in the URL and has length limitations.
        
    -   `POST`: Sends form data as part of the HTTP request body. Suitable for sensitive data (e.g., passwords) and larger amounts of data.
        
-   **`enctype`:** (Only for `method="POST"`) Specifies how the form data should be encoded when submitted.
    
    -   `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (default): All characters are encoded before sending.
        
    -   `multipart/form-data`: Used when uploading files (e.g., `type="file"`).
        
    -   `text/plain`: Sends data as plain text (not recommended for most cases).
        
-   **`target`:** Same as `<a>` tag's `target` (e.g., `_blank` to submit to a new tab).
    
-   **`autocomplete`:** (HTML5) Controls whether the browser should provide autofill suggestions for the form or its fields (`on` or `off`).
    

**Code Block:**

```
<form action="/submit-registration" method="POST" autocomplete="on">
    <h2>User Registration</h2>
    <!-- Form elements will go here -->
    <p>Please fill out the form below:</p>
    <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
    <button type="submit">Register</button>
</form>

<hr>

<form action="/search" method="GET">
    <input type="search" name="query" placeholder="Search...">
    <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>

```

### 8.2 The `<input>` Element (Various Types)

The `<input>` tag is the most versatile form element, used to create various interactive controls. It's a self-closing tag.

**Why used?** To collect different types of data from the user.

**How used?** The `type` attribute determines the kind of input control.

**Common Parameters/Conditions (applicable to many input types):**

-   **`type`:** (Mandatory) Specifies the type of input control (e.g., `text`, `password`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `submit`).
    
-   **`name`:** (Mandatory for form submission) The name of the input field, used to identify the data when it's sent to the server.
    
-   **`id`:** (Recommended) A unique identifier for the input element, used for linking with `<label>` and for JavaScript manipulation.
    
-   **`value`:** The initial value of the input field. For `submit` and `reset` buttons, this is the text displayed on the button.
    
-   **`placeholder`:** (HTML5) A short hint that describes the expected value of an input field (e.g., a sample value or a brief description of the format). The hint is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value.
    
-   **`required`:** (HTML5) A boolean attribute. If present, the field must be filled out before the form can be submitted.
    
-   **`readonly`:** A boolean attribute. If present, the input field cannot be modified by the user, but its value will still be submitted with the form.
    
-   **`disabled`:** A boolean attribute. If present, the input field is unusable and un-clickable. Its value will _not_ be submitted with the form.
    
-   **`autofocus`:** (HTML5) A boolean attribute. If present, the input field will automatically get focus when the page loads. Only one element can have this per page.
    
-   **`autocomplete`:** (HTML5) Controls autofill for this specific field (`on` or `off`), overriding the form's `autocomplete`.

### 8.3 The `<label>` Element

**Why used?** The `<label>` element provides a caption for an item in a user interface. It's crucial for **accessibility**, as clicking the label will focus the associated input field, and screen readers will read the label when the input is focused.

**How used?**

1.  **Implicit Labeling:** Place the input element _inside_ the `<label>` tags.
    
2.  **Explicit Labeling (Recommended):** Use the `for` attribute of the `<label>` element and set its value to the `id` of the input element it labels.
    

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   **`for`:** (For explicit labeling) The `id` of the form-related element with which the label is associated. This is the preferred method.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<!-- Explicit Labeling (Recommended) -->
<label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName"><br><br>

<!-- Implicit Labeling -->
<label>Last Name:
    <input type="text" name="lastName">
</label>

```

-   A document can have multiple `<header>` elements (e.g., one for the page, one for an `<article>`).
    
-   It's a block-level element.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<header>
    <img src="images/logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
    <h1>Welcome to Our Website</h1>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/about">About Us</a></li>
            <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>

### `<main>`

**Why used?** Represents the dominant content of the `<body>`. This content is unique to the document and excludes sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.

**How used?** There should only be one `<main>` element per document.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   It's a block-level element.
    
-   It must not be a descendant of `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`, or `<nav>`.

### `<footer>`

**Why used?** Represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or for the root element (`<body>`). A footer typically contains information about its section, such as who wrote it, copyright data, or related links.

**How used?** Place copyright notices, author information, contact details, sitemaps, or navigation links within.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   A document can have multiple `<footer>` elements (e.g., one for the page, one for an `<article>`).
    
-   It's a block-level element.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2025 My Awesome Website. All rights reserved.</p>
    <address>
        Contact us at: <a href="mailto:info@example.com">info@example.com</a>

### `<details>` and `<summary>`

**Why used?**

-   **`<details>`:** Creates a disclosure widget from which the user can retrieve additional information.
    
-   **`<summary>`:** Provides a summary or caption for the content of its parent `<details>` element. When clicked, it toggles the visibility of the details content.
    

**How used?** Place `<summary>` as the first child of `<details>`, followed by the content you want to hide/show.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   `<details>` is a block-level element.
    
-   **`open`:** (Boolean attribute on `<details>`) If present, the details will be visible by default.
    
-   `<summary>` is an inline element.
    
-   Great for FAQs, collapsible sections, or showing/hiding advanced options.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<details>
    <summary>What is HTML?</summary>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>
</details>

<details open>
    <summary>Click to hide this section</summary>
    <p>This content is visible by default because the `open` attribute is present.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
    </ul>
</details>

```

### `<dialog>`

**Why used?** The `<dialog>` element represents a dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow.

**How used?** It's typically used with JavaScript to control its opening and closing.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   **`open`:** (Boolean attribute) If present, the dialog is visible and interactive. Without it, the dialog is hidden by default.
    
-   It's a block-level element.
    
-   When `open`, it renders as a modal dialog by default.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<button onclick="document.getElementById('myDialog').showModal()">Open Dialog</button>

<dialog id="myDialog">
    <h2>Welcome to the Dialog!</h2>
    <p>This is a modal dialog. You can put any content here.</p>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('myDialog').close()">Close</button>
</dialog>

```

## 10. Generic Containers (`<div>`, `<span>`)

While semantic HTML5 elements are preferred for their meaning, `<div>` and `<span>` remain essential for grouping content when no other semantic element is appropriate, primarily for styling with CSS or manipulating with JavaScript.

### `<div>` (Division)

**Why used?** The `<div>` element is a generic block-level container. It has no semantic meaning on its own but is used to group other HTML elements together.

**How used?** Use it when you need to apply CSS styles to a block of content or to create a layout section, and no other semantic HTML5 element fits.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   It's a block-level element. It typically starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
    
-   Overuse of `<div>` (known as "div soup") should be avoided by preferring semantic elements when possible.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<div class="product-card">
    <h3>Product Title</h3>
    <p>Product description goes here.</p>
    <button>Add to Cart</button>
</div>

<div id="main-content-wrapper">
    <!-- All main content of the page -->
</div>

```

### `<span>` (Span)

**Why used?** The `<span>` element is a generic inline container. It has no semantic meaning on its own but is used to group a small portion of text or other inline elements.

**How used?** Use it when you need to apply CSS styles to a specific part of text within a line, or to target a small inline section with JavaScript.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   It's an inline element. It does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as its content requires.
    
-   Cannot contain block-level elements directly.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>This sentence has some <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">important words</span> highlighted.</p>
<p>The <span class="price">$99.99</span> is a special offer.</p>

```

## 11. HTML Entities

**Why used?** HTML entities are special codes used to display reserved characters (like `<` or `>`) that have special meaning in HTML, or to display characters not easily typed on a keyboard (like copyright symbols, mathematical symbols, or non-breaking spaces).

**How used?** They start with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`). They can be either named entities (e.g., `&lt;`) or numerical entities (e.g., `&#60;`).

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   Always use entities for `<` (`&lt;`), `>` (`&gt;`), and `&` (`&amp;`) when you want them to appear as literal characters in your text, not as part of HTML tags or entities.
    
-   `&nbsp;` (non-breaking space) is useful for preventing a line break between two words or for adding multiple spaces (browsers collapse multiple regular spaces into one).
    

**Code Block:**

```
<p>This is less than: &lt;</p>
<p>This is greater than: &gt;</p>
<p>This is an ampersand: &amp;</p>
<p>Copyright symbol: &copy;</p>
<p>Registered trademark: &reg;</p>
<p>Euro symbol: &euro;</p>
<p>Non-breaking space: Hello&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World</p>

```

## 12. HTML Comments

**Why used?** Comments are used to add notes or explanations within your HTML code. They are ignored by the browser and are not displayed on the webpage. They are invaluable for:

-   Explaining complex sections of code.
    
-   Leaving reminders for yourself or other developers.
    
-   Temporarily disabling a block of code without deleting it.
    

**How used?** Comments start with `<!--` and end with `-->`.

**Parameters/Conditions:**

-   Comments cannot be nested (you cannot put a comment inside another comment).
    
-   Avoid placing comments inside attribute values.
    

**Code Block:**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Comments Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- This is a single-line comment -->

    <!--
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It can span across several lines
        to explain a larger section of code.
    -->

    <h1>My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    <!--
    <p>This paragraph is commented out and will not be displayed.</p>
    -->

</body>
</html>

```

## 13. HTML Best Practices

Adhering to best practices ensures your HTML is clean, maintainable, accessible, and performs well.

1.  **Use Semantic HTML5:** Always prefer semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`) over generic `<div>` elements when their meaning aligns with your content. This improves accessibility, SEO, and code readability.
    
    -   **Reason:** Semantic tags provide meaning to content for browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies.
        
    -   **Example:** Use `<nav>` for navigation links instead of `<div class="navigation">`.
        
2.  **Validate Your HTML:** Use the W3C Markup Validation Service regularly.
    
    -   **Reason:** Validation helps catch syntax errors, ensures cross-browser compatibility, and makes debugging easier.
        
    -   **Tool:**  [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/ "null")
        
3.  **Always Include `alt` Attributes for Images:** Every `<img>` tag should have an `alt` attribute.
    
    -   **Reason:** Essential for accessibility (screen readers), SEO, and when images fail to load.
        
    -   **Example:**  `<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">`
        
4.  **Link Labels to Inputs:** Use the `<label>` element with the `for` attribute linked to the `id` of its corresponding input.
    
    -   **Reason:** Improves usability (clicking the label focuses the input) and accessibility.
        
    -   **Example:**  `<label for="username">Username:</label><input type="text" id="username">`
        
5.  **Use Proper Document Structure:** Always start with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, include `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
    
    -   **Reason:** Ensures consistent rendering across browsers and proper interpretation of your document.
        
6.  **Character Encoding:** Always specify `UTF-8` in the `<head>`.
    
    -   **Reason:** Prevents character display issues (mojibake) across different languages and symbols.
        
    -   **Example:**  `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
        
7.  **Responsive Viewport Meta Tag:** Include the viewport meta tag for responsive design.
    
    -   **Reason:** Ensures your website adapts correctly to various device screen sizes.
        
    -   **Example:**  `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
        
8.  **Clean and Indented Code:** Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces) and proper line breaks.
    
    -   **Reason:** Makes your code readable and easy to understand for yourself and others.
        
9.  **Use Comments Judiciously:** Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of your HTML.
    
    -   **Reason:** Improves code maintainability and collaboration.
        
10.  **Avoid Inline Styles and JavaScript (Mostly):** While HTML has `style` attributes and `onclick` events, it's generally best practice to separate concerns.
    
    -   **Reason:** Keep HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for behavior. This makes your code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.
        
    -   **Exception:** For very small, isolated cases or quick demos, inline styles/scripts might be used, but avoid them in production code.
        
11.  **Minimize Nesting:** While nesting is necessary, avoid excessively deep nesting of elements.
    
    -   **Reason:** Deep nesting can make CSS selectors more complex, increase file size, and sometimes impact performance.
        
12.  **Use Lowercase for Tags and Attributes:** While HTML is case-insensitive, using lowercase is the convention and improves readability.
    
    -   **Reason:** Consistency and adherence to common coding standards.
